      <abstract>This data publication contains vegetation and fuels measurements from 2001-2022 at the Lubrecht Fire &amp; Fire Surrogate Study Site, which was established in 2000 and includes four treatments: an untreated control, prescribed burn, a thinning, and a thinning followed by prescribed burn. This study site is located at the University of Montana's Lubrecht Experimental Forest in western Montana, approximately 50 kilometers east of Missoula. Data span 20 years from pre-treatment in 2001 through 2022, 20 years post-treatment. The publication includes six tabular data sets (comma-separated values (CSV) files): 1) tree level data (≥ 10.16 centimeter (cm) diameter at breast height (DBH), 2) plot level sapling density by species and diameter class, 3) plot level seedling density by species and height class, 4) plot level understory vegetation cover, 5) plot level fuel loading, and 6) plot level aboveground carbon stocks and potential fire severity (i.e., predicted tree mortality if a fire occurs).</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term (15-20 year) treatment effects (i.e., forest vegetation, fuels, potential fire severity, and carbon dynamics) of prescribed fire and mechanical thinning, as a way to reduce high-severity wildfire and restore ponderosa pine forests.</purpose>

      <descgeog>The study site is located on the University of Montana’s Lubrecht Experimental Forest in western Montana, USA (46°53’N, 113°26’W) and is part of a national program to study the effects of silvicultural methods designed to reduce fire hazard in forests with a historical frequent, low-to-moderate severity fire regime (Stephens et al. 2009). Mean annual temperature is 7 degrees Celsius (°C), ranging from a mean minimum of 0°C and maximum of 13°C. The area receives an average of 50 centimeters (cm) of precipitation annually, about half in the form of snow (Fiedler et al. 2010). Our study site is located in a second-growth forest that established after widespread harvesting in the late 1800s to early 1900s. The forest is dominated by ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Lawson &amp; C. Lawson var. ponderosa C. Lawson) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii [Mirbel] Franco var. glauca [Beissn.] Franco), with scattered western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas ex Louden). The historical mean fire return interval was 7 years (range of 2 to 14 years), but fire frequency greatly declined after 1871 (Grissino-Mayer et al. 2006). The study site had not burned since the late 1800s, although there was moderate grazing throughout the 1900s (Gundale et al. 2005).

    <logic>All data were collected within the same block, unit, and plots. Plot identification and tree numbers are consistent throughout the data sets.</logic>
    <complete>Not all data were collected at each time step, so the number of sampling events varies throughout the data. There were some instances where data from individual trees were inadvertently not collected, in these cases the data cells were left as blank cells. Fuels data were accidently not collected in 2022 in Block 2, mechanical treatment, plots 29 and 33. At each timestep where tree diameter was measured, we tagged new trees that had grown to 10.16 cm or greater diameter. These in-growth trees have blank values for diameters in prior sampling years because they were not large enough to be in the tree class.</complete>

        <methdesc>EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND TREATMENT DESCRIPTION

Three, 36-hectare (ha) blocks consisting of 4, 9-ha units each were established in 2000. This study was a randomized complete block design, with each unit within a block randomly assigned one of four treatments: control, burn-only, thin-only, and thin-burn. Treatments are also called control, fire, mechanical, and mechanical+fire. The control treatment involved no thinning or burning. The burn-only treatment involved prescribed broadcast burning in the spring, but no thinning. Thin-only consisted of a low thinning and improvement/selection cutting, but no burning. The thin-burn treatment entailed thinning with the same prescription as the thin-only treatment but was followed by broadcast burning the following year to reduce logging slash (i.e., tree tops and limbs) and existing surface fuels. See Gundale et al. (2005) and Fiedler et al. (2010) for more detailed treatment prescriptions and pre-treatment conditions.

In each unit, 36 gridded plots (0.04 ha) were established as part of the larger, multi-disciplinary study. At ten of these points a 20 meter (m) x 50 m (0.1 ha) plot was established for sampling trees ≥ 10 cm diameter at breast height (DBH; 1.37 m above ground). Control treatments were not manipulated. Thinning and burning treatments were designed to restore stands towards historical conditions by reducing tree density, particularly shade-tolerant Douglas-fir, and encourage shade-intolerant species such as ponderosa pine, while also reducing the hazard of stand-replacing wildfire.

The goal of all treated units was to create fire-resistant forests in which 80% of basal area of overstory trees would survive a wildfire burning under 80th percentile weather conditions. In the thin-only and thin-burn units, a low thinning with improvement/selection cutting to favor ponderosa pine ≥ 40 cm DBH reduced average residual basal area to a target of 11 squared meters (m²) per ha.

Thinning was conducted in the winter of 2001. Burn-only and thin-burn units were broadcast burned in May and June 2002. The prescribed burns were designed to reduce surface fuel loading and ladder fuels consisting of seedling and saplings.


TREE ATTRIBUTES (\Data\trees.csv)

The tree class includes trees ≥ 10.16 cm diameter at breast height (DBH, 1.37 m above ground) collected on the Whittaker plots. The Whittaker plots were randomly selected plot locations from 36 systematically located grid points within each of the twelve treatment units, 10 plots per treatment unit, for a total of 120 plots. Trees in each of the Whittaker plots were permanently tagged and status (e.g., alive, dead), species identity, DBH, total height, and crown length were recorded. Trees were measured prior to treatment in 2000 and immediately after harvest in 2001. All trees were assessed annually from 2002 to 2005 for changes in status. In 2005, 2012, and 2020, we conducted a complete remeasurement of trees following the initial protocol, including tagging and measuring new trees as they grew into the tree class.


SAPLING DENSITY (\Data\saplings.csv)

The sapling class includes trees &lt; 10.16 cm DBH and taller than 1.37 m. Saplings were measured on five, 100 m² subplots within each Whittaker plot. See Metlen and Fiedler (2006) for plot diagram and details. Live saplings were tallied by species and diameter class, where small sapling: 0.1 cm ≤ DBH &lt; 3 cm; medium sapling: 3 cm ≤ DBH &lt; 6 cm; large sapling: 6 cm ≤ DBH &lt; 10.16 cm. Saplings were measured in 2002 and 2022. 


SEEDLING DENSITY (\Data\seedlings.csv)

The seedling class includes trees &lt; 1.37 m tall. Seedlings were measured on twenty, 1 m² subplots within each Whittaker plot. See Metlen and Fiedler (2006) for plot diagram and details. Live seedlings were tallied by species and height class, where small seedling: 10 cm ≤ height &lt; 50 cm; large seedling: 50 cm ≤ height &lt; 137 cm. Seedlings were measured in 2002 and 2022. 


UNDERSTORY VEGETATION (\Data\understory.csv)

Understory vegetation was identified by species (or by genus for difficult to identify species) and cover was estimated on twelve, 1 m² subplots per Whittaker plot. See Metlen and Fiedler (2006) for plot diagram and details. Understory vegetation was measured in 2002 and 2022. 


FUEL LOADING (\Data\fuels.csv)

A modified Brown's (1974) protocol was used to quantify 1-hour (woody material &lt; 0.64 cm diameter), 10-hour (0.64 cm ≤ diameter &lt; 2.54 cm), 100-hour (2.54 cm ≤ diameter &lt; 7.62 cm), and 1000-hour+ (diameter ≥ 7.62 cm) timelag classes. On each of the 36 grid points, two, 15.2 m transects were established; 1-hour and 10-hour fuels were tallied for 1.8 m of the length, 100-hour fuels were tallied for 3.7 m, and 1000-hour+ fuel diameters were recorded along the entire transect lengths. Duff and litter depths were each measured along transects at 4.6 m and 10.7 m from plot center and then combined for forest floor loading. Fuels were measured in 2002, 2010, 2016, and 2022.


ABOVEGROUND CARBON STOCK

To estimate carbon stocks and stable carbon stocks, surface fuels data and measured tree data were input into the Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FFE-FVS; Reinhardt et al. 2009, Dixon 2018) to calculate plot-scale canopy fuel characteristics and potential fire behavior for our two measurement years (2002, 2022). Potential fire behavior was based on FFE-FVS’s default “severe” fire weather scenario (4% 10-hour (h) fuel moisture, 21.1°C ambient temperature, and 32.2 km h⁻¹ wind speed at 6.1 m). Output generated from FFE-FVS POTFIRE and CARBON reports included probability of torching (pTorch; %), probability of mortality by overstory basal area (pMort; %), and total aboveground live carbon estimates (includes live seedlings, saplings, and trees, including stems, branches, and foliage; totC; megagrams (Mg) ha⁻¹). Stable carbon (stableC) was calculated using pMort and totC from FFE-FVS as (1 - pMort) × totC. Thus, stableC ranged from 0 Mg ha⁻¹ (where pMort was 100%) to equal to totC (where pMort was 0%). Carbon stocks and potential fire severity were estimated for 2002 and 2022.
